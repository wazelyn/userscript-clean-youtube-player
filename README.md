# userscript-clean-youtube-player
Make that youtube player look pretty darn clean. Helps you watch your videos in focus, like videos are supposed to be watched.

Use with greasemonkey/tampermonkey.

One of the helpful tools I use to avoid noisy nonsense on youtube.

I also use

1. Adblock/adblockplus. Highly recommend blocking the overlays and "recommended videos" advertisements at the end (do you-tube really think I'm going to watch anime and video game speedruns after watching a science lecture or an investor interview? Yeah, you-tube would think that. But it's not what I want at that time, and I'm going to block it because it's irrelevant.). It's also possible to target and hide some of the noisy statistics, elements, avatar images, and so on.

2. A script to hide the "recommended for you" videos in the "related videos" section. The "recommended for you" videos are related to what youtube thinks I'm going to watch more of.

3. A script to add a comments toggle button, and toggle them OFF by default. ... (Actually, is there a way to tell if video comments are set to manual approval? I don't want to see shitty fucking comments on your shitty fucking wall that any asshole or benevolent helper can just post on without approval. I mean, if you care about your video you can take N minutes to skim the comments to have 100% useful comments, instead of a trashy public pissfest. I would have approved comments toggled on; this would also help me tell which creators fucking care about their content and who's just hosting a pissfest.)
